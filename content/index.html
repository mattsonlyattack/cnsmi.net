			<h2>Dr. Berker</h2>
			<img src="images/gravatar.jpg" width="40" height="40" alt="firefox" class="float-left" />
			<p>Dr. Berker has been carrying out neuropsychological assessments of children, adults and older adults for over 25 years.
			He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan under Aaron Smith, founder of the International Neuropsychological Society.
			Although most neuropsychologists use technicians to administer tests, Dr. Berker personally interviews each patient and administers all the neuropsychological tests.
			He understands that people can be anxious and apprehensive about having to undergo a neuropsychological examination,
			so he always tries his best to help each patient feel relaxed and at ease. Dr. Berker sees patients in his Ann Arbor office on Mondays and Tuesdays,
			and the remainder of the week sees patients in his Portage office.</p>
